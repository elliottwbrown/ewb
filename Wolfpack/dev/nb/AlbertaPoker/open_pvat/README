This is the basic compiling and running information, as well as background 
information on the OPEN PVAT project, based on Morgan Kahns DIVAT algorithm 
and utilities.

Requirements:
The preflop pot equity table
An evaluation tool for evaluating the hand strength of a particular hand.
We have a hand strength wrapper available for use with the PokerEval library 
v1.36+ which can be found here: pokersource.sourceforge.net/

Compiling:
If using poker-eval:

Place the poker-eval library in the libs folder as well as
the hand_strength wrapper we have made available

Type make at the console from within the open_pvat directory.  
This should compile the library, as well as the source files.

If not using poker-eval:
You will most likely need to modify the makefile as it looks for poker-eval as
a lib target.  As well, you will need to write an interface into the pvat code
to handle the calls to hand_strength.  See the hand_strength.c and 
hand_strength.h wrappers for details.

Running:
Run open_pvat with a hand history file.  

The hand history file must be in the following format:
HandNumber:P1,P2:Seat<ACTION_SEQUENCE>:<CARD_SEQUENCE>:P1Winnings,P2Winnings

<ACTION_SEQUENCE> refers to rcf for each of raise call and fold, rounds are 
separated by /

<CARD_SEQUENCE> refers to the cards sequence for the round.
The sequence goes P1 Cards,P2 Cards|/Flop Cards/Turn Card/RiverCard
A card is <RANK><SUIT> where <RANK> is 2-9,T,J,Q,K,A and <SUIT> is s,d,h,c

Example:
1:Chump1,Chump2:0rc/rrrc/crf:4dKd,2s9d|/2d7sKh/Js:-50,50
